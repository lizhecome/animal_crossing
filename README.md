## Project Name: WildGuard
### Blockchain Platform: Sui
### Core Token: Wild

## Vision

WildGuard aims to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) with wildlife conservation, creating an innovative platform where users contribute to protecting endangered animals while engaging with DeFi-powered incentives.

## Key Features

1. **Wild Token Issuance**
   - **Mechanism**: Wild tokens are minted on a 1:1 basis with SUI tokens as the underlying asset.
   - **Stability**: SUI tokens back Wild, ensuring trust and value.
   - **Lifecycle**: When Wild tokens are redeemed for SUI, they are permanently burned, keeping the system balanced.
   - **Utility**: Wild tokens can be used to:
     - Adopt animal NFTs.
     - Vote on wildlife conservation initiatives.
     - Earn rewards in DeFi games.

2. **Endangered Animal NFT Adoption**
   - **Exclusive NFTs**: Each NFT represents an endangered species and contains detailed information about the animal.
   - **Adoption**: Users can adopt these NFTs by spending Wild tokens.
   - **Release**: Users can return the NFT to reclaim the equivalent amount of Wild tokens at any time.
   - **Engagement**: By owning NFTs, users contribute to conservation while enjoying an emotional connection with their chosen animals.

3. **Economic Model**

   **Flow of Funds**:
   1. **Liquidity Mining**:
     - Upon NFT adoption, the equivalent SUI underlying the Wild token is deployed into liquidity mining.
     - This generates yield while keeping the user’s principal safe.
   2. **Revenue Distribution**:
     - 20% for Wildlife Protection: Direct contributions to conservation organizations and initiatives.
     - 80% to User Rewards: Returns are allocated to a reward pool and distributed back to users.
   3. **Reward Weighting**:
     - Calculated based on:
       - Animal Rarity: Rarer animals receive higher contributions.
       - NFT Mint Time: Older NFTs accumulate greater rewards.
       - Hedging Mechanism: This balances incentives, prioritizing funding for more critically endangered species.

## Advantages
- **Impact-Driven**: Every NFT adoption directly supports wildlife conservation efforts.
- **Zero Principal Risk**: Users gain rewards while retaining the ability to withdraw their principal at any time.
- **Sustainability**: The platform sustains its mission through DeFi profits rather than relying solely on donations.
- **Education**: Animal NFTs spread awareness about endangered species, fostering global conservation efforts.
